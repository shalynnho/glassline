=========

ConveyorFamily design is primarily in the factory.misc.ConveyorFamilyEntity. 
This has SensorAgent, ConveyorAgent, and PopupAgent, which are each in factory.agents.

Running Unit Tests:

- All tests are located in factory.test
- The primary tests of complexity are in PopupTests
- In Eclipse just run PopupTests, ConveyorTests, and SensorTests with its built-in "Run as JUnit Test"
