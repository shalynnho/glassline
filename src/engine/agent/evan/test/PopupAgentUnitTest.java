	 * This is a long, complicated test that goes through everything the PopupAgent ever has to do.
	 * First come two consecutive pieces of glass both needing machine processing, so the popup loads both of the machines.
	 * Then comes an arbitrary number of glass not needing processing (in this case 5), and the popup sends them through.
	 * When a piece of glass needing to be processed comes, the popup will not take it because both machines are occupied,
	 * so there is nowhere for it to go. When one of the machines finishes processing the glass, the popup releases it from the
	 * machine and sends it to the next CF.  Then it loads the now empty machine with the previously pending glass needing processing.
	 * Then the popup waits for the machines to finish processing the two current pieces of glass and sequentially releases and then
	 * sends on each of them.
